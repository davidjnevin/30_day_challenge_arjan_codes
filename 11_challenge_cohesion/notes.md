# Cohesion and Coupling

Cohesion: The degree to which elements within a module are functionally related. High cohesion (preferred) means each module has a single, well-defined task or responsibility.

Coupling: The level of interdependency between different modules. Low coupling (preferred) indicates a design where modules are independent, making the overall system easier to manage and modify.
